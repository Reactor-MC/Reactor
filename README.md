## About

Reactor is a high-performance Hytale server platform developed in Java, designed to redefine the current landscape of Hytale server software. Emphasizing efficiency, scalability, and modular architecture, Reactor sets a new standard for modern server solutions.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is under heavy development! Not all features are done!
>
> [!NOTE]
> There is no sandbox in the plugins because, ultimately, it is a Hytale server, nothing very important that needs security.
> This means that plugins will be able to access other plugins (configuration and jar).
> Perhaps it will be implemented in the future, but for now it is not a priority.
