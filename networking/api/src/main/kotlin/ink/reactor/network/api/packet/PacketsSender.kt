/**
 * A high-performance packet dispatcher optimized for sending packets to multiple connections.

 * [PlayerConnection]s. It is specifically designed to reuse packet serialization
 * when sending the same packet to multiple players, avoiding redundant encode operations.
 *
 * For sending a packet to a single player, [PlayerConnection.sendPacket] is a
 * convenience method. However, when broadcasting the same packet to multiple players,
 * using [PacketsSender] provides significantly better performance.
